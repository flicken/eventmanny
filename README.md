Event Manny
===========

Bring a bit of structure to your chaotic schedule.

Features
--------
 * Create: Easy entering of multiple events
 * Conflicts: See conflicts for recently entered events
 * Recent updates: See recent updates for events in the next month.
     This is to support syncing recent changes to a paper calendar

TODO
----
 * Select (multiple) calendars
 * Configurable time for "recent" updates
 * Grouping of events (e.g. concert series or rehearsals that are related,
      but not regularly scheduled)
 * Easy exception handling (e.g. school is out, so no regularly scheduled
      events)
 * Attach image to events / series (e.g. picture of poster for concert series)
 * Even easier entering of series (e.g. concert series that has mostly the
     same info,  but different dates, times, location, headline acts, etc)
